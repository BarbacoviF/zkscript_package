abstract = {This handbook provides a complete reference on elliptic and hyperelliptic curve cryptography. Addressing every aspect of the field, the book contains all of the background necessary to understand the theory and security of cryptosystems as well as the algorithms that can be used to implement them. This second edition features the latest developments on pairing-based cryptography, new ideas on index-calculus attacks, improved algorithms for genus-2 arithmetic, and a number of other new additions. It also includes many new applications and provides better explanations on some of the more mathematical presentations.}
